Good news first- I'm passing all the tests. I've got a bunch of memory leaks coming
from my init and destroy functions as shown by the tester, I've got a heap buffer overflow occurring when I allocate my pointer array, and there's 15,000 nukes at stake.

Just another day at the office.

And the bad news?

I'm getting sick of minecraft music.

I've added all of the starter code. I'm going to complete a drawing and visual
walkthrough so I have a thorough understanding of how everything is supposed to 
work before I begin implementing it.

Hopefully this makes it so that I don't waste time refactoring everything later 
on.
